# Yuki's Tactical Display

Adds a tactical display to the combat UI. Shows your fleet along with their assignments and status. You can also use it to set ships to retreat, seek escorts, or search & destroy (cant disable the S&D order though).

Has an option to show the enemy fleet on the right side of the screen as well, useful for tournaments or just general gameplay purposes.

## Requirements

Requires magiclib and lunalib.
